# About

Hello! I am a current undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying computer science and data science. This blog is meant to document the journey of finding my own personal niche within the tech field as well as a lttile bit of everything else. I hope everyone reading can either learn something or at least have a bit of fun here. Welcome!

I am currently just starting to perform research at [Chen Labs](https://www.chenlab-ucsf.org) within the UCSF Weill Institute of Neurosciences where I am working on various ML models for epilepsy research. Meanwhile, I am also currently involved with [California Partners for Advanced Transportation Technology(PATH)](https://its.berkeley.edu/research-centers/path) where I am analyzing the latest data from autonomous vehicle tests and am helping to build [Gravidy Platforms Inc.](https://www.gravityplatforms.com), an innovative social media platform bringing control back to the users. For more details or to see my contact, [Click here](cv) to see my full CV, and [here](BenjaminY20261.pdf) to download my resume.

For fun, I enjoy badminton, night walking, cooking, reading(fiction/biographies), tetris, and talking about anything with anyone. 

Please reach out! I would love to talk with you whether that would to ask questions, give advice, or just chat.
