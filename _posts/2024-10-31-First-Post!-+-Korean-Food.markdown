Hi Again!

Welcome to my page. Hopefully this will be populated with a lot of cool stuff soon.

For now, lets talk about the cuisine that has captivated me for the past few months. Ever since getting to Berkeley, I've probably had Korean food 3-4 times every week thanks to [T-Toust](https://t-toust.com). The beef tofu soup (Sundubu-jjigae), is so simple yet so flavorfull and works perfectly with a bowl of rice. The spicy pork is also great when I'm feeling particularily carnivorous. I highly reccommend anyone to try them out if they're in Berkeley!

To try to replicate the tofu soup, I've been using BCD Tofu packets to a kinda successfull degree. Heres what I noticed
* You need like 2 inches of water in the beginning. Tofu releases a ton of water and many times has led to the bowl overflowing and splashing all over the kitchen.
* Don't add too many topping or you'll barely be able to taste the flavor packets.

The next step is to make my own tofu flavoring with gochugaru and gochujang or Korean Chili Flakes and Korean Chili Paste. I'll post updates with a recipe when I figure out the right proportions.

On another note, last week I hosted dinner with solely Korean food. Heres a picture ![](/images/IMG_0432.png) In a zigzag order from bottom to up, left to right, we have Japchae, Tteok-bokki, Kimichi-jjigae, bulgogi, and various side dishes. Out of sight are the scallion pancakes that I made, which were suboptimal and lacking crispiness. Everything else was pretty great and approved by friends.

I'm committed to learning more and the next dishes on my list are Bossam, Samgyetang (Where can I find ginseng), and Jajangmyeon. If anyone has any advice or questions, please reach out!

bye.
